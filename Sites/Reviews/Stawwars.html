        <p>
           I really loved this movie, The Space Adventure.
            <br><br>
            A Kamen Rider,An Old Man where people died young , A Mercenery who pilots spaceship, , An Gold colour android
            and A Hairy being 
        </p>
        <p>
            The story being started with attack on a space station, with Ambasador being a princess Lela 
			<br>
			this become into story of first few minutes of movie being about 2 Android, Golden Droid and R2D2.
			Then this story introduces the Protagonist, Luke Skywalker <br>
			he is like a kamen rider 
			man lost all his family in a day because he came to posses this two androids 
			and decided to persue justice and help the rebels
			<br>
			Obi-wan is great, Love the Powersystem of The Force <br>
			Better haki for real<br>
			
			The Mercenery who pilot a spaceship, Han Solo 
			he is the goat
			Man is best 
			<br><br>
			Princess Lela, Like her, though she kinda sucks in this movie. felt like a plot device at most insted of actual charecter
			<br>
			Excieted for next in this franchise

            This Chapter was a mixed bag for me, it was boring for earlier part but the final half was amazing

            This part was amazing, really changing the tide of battle and how much fear Amiya is causing,she is best girl after all
            <br><br>
            Best part of this chapter was obviously Ch'en <br>

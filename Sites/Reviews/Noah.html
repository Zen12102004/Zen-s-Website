            So what is Chaos;Head Noah for me?
        </p>
        <p id="AnswerFont">
            Chaos;Head NoAH for me is a case study on 2008/9 <b>Internet Culture which is still internet culture of today.
            </b><br>
            Takumi represents Otaku/Weebs, though a bit extreme. 
            <br>
            Takumi's habit are very similar to what we see today, Takumi suffer from lonliness ,
            which we see very well in today's era. <br> Many people today use Generative AI to have talks, letting their <b>delusion</b>
            run wild. Having sexual talks ,<br>
            flirrting and even imagining this chatbots as girlfriend/boyfriend. Something which we see Takumi did with imagining as Seira, the imaginary gf of Takumi 
            <br>Takumi represents everybody of us.

            The New Gen Cases
        </p>
        <p id="AnswerFont">
            New Gen Cases are all have one purpose, they are made to target Takumi<br>
            sono me dare no me (Whose Eyes are Those Eyes), everything about the cases are there for Takumi to awaken
            <br> For a God to awaken, he must suffer.

            Nanami Route
        </p>
        
        <p id="AnswerFont">
            Nanami Route happened because Takumi coudn't handle the situation that Nanami died. 
            <br><br><img src="Assets/Noahimage.JPG">
            <br>
            The Entire Route happened inside Takumi's dream, He <b>simulated</b> a worldline where Nanami didn't suffer 
            while he was in coma, he simulated a worldline. <br>That worldline had a different New Gen case, as afterall it a worldline which diverged to where Nanami is saved
            <br>
            But once Takumi awake and face the reality, Everything came crumbling down. and Takumi was force to make a choice, To choose which sister to saved
            <br>
            <ul style="color: black;">
                <li>The delusional ideal sister</li>
                <li>The suffering Real Sister</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
        <p id="AnswerFont">
            But unfortunatly for him, 3rd Melt happened and it make Takumi with the first choice
           <br> He forced to choice the blissful dream unknowing of what happened to real him.
            <br>Dying while leaving a dream together with his Ideal Sister
            <br>
            <br>
            This Route when I first read, I hated it <br><b>But</b> while i did find first half boring, I didn't hate this Route
            <br>
            This Route tell us about takumi, after all real life suck and it sucks more if somebody close to us die, we feel bad, hellish
            We too suffer if somebody close to us die,After all if they die, a part of us also die<br>
            An excelent Route which does study on form of grief and how rejecting reality of situation

            Yua/Mia Route
        </p>
        <p id="AnswerFont">
            Like Nanami Route, This Route also deals with Death, Mia or how she told us, Yua 
            Yua died during the Group Dive.<br> Something Mia blames herself, after all she is the one who requested her sister to go in her place.
            <br>
            For her, she is the one who killed Yua. Which she coudn't accept and so unlike Takumi who with grief simulated an entire worldline where his sister lives , <br>
            Mia become Yua truly, and goes on a delusiona spree to make Takumi accept he is Main Killer
            <br>
            <img src="Assets/Noahimage1.png" style="width: 500px;">
            <br>
            This Routes ends with Mia as Yua wanting to let her do sucide, and she does but she regrets it, sure she wanted to 
            but she still wants to live to which takumi make her death a delusion. The Yua that Mia was died 
            allowing Mia to bloom again
            <br>
            <img src="Assets/Noahimage2.JPG">
            <br>
            This part of <a href="https://youtu.be/aS4shuOLerQ?si=6BUvD9SxMEtdK2cL" >Ending</a> fits her perfectly
            <br><img src="Assets/Noahimage3.JPG">
            <br>
            Takumi like a god guide Mia again to live.

            Ayase/FES of Phanthasam Route
        </p>
        <p id="AnswerFont">
            This Route is  <br>
            While previous two route i liked in this reread, This Route i love when i originaly read <br>
            This Route's start is unknown as we see Ayase already having three Di Sword with her <br>
            <img src="Assets/Noahimage4.png" width="500px"><br>
            Nanami, Rimi and her own Sword which could mean Norose make Rimi left Nanami tio go to Blood to lure out Shogun Takumi
            and FES took there Di Sword at the Hospital. 
            <br>
            The Book of Gladiou Saga, One which looks empty in inside and only Ayase can read it. Well it does reminding me of the Video D-Mail Okabe send in Steins;Gate which is 2nd entry.<br>
            <br><br>
            Ayase is Top<br>
            <img src="Assets/Noahimage5.png" width="500px">
            <br><br>
            Ayase seeing the world different as if she is seeing world using a filter, lets call it wicked-heart filter
            <br>
            Love how it goes into factor of world, all 6.7 B People can see world differently, they all have different filter or so as Ayse belive 
            <br>This does brings question on how GAIA handle multiple views<br>
            The Song FES Writes, Its a profecy, which told us about how to defeat wicked-heart king <br>
            Norose be like, standing alongside his N2 and suddenly a literal Di Sword strike you and N2 
            because FES Song literaly realboot Noah-2 deactivating
            <br>
            Peak Route <br>
            <img src="Assets/Noahimage6.JPG">
            <br>
            Love the ending with Ayase finnaly seeing the wonderful blue world of Takumi
